- Removed the data_collect directory.  Subsequent releases should contain
  database data collection scripts int their respective database scripts
  directory.  Moved any general usage scripts into the scripts/ directory.
- Removed the dbdriver directory.  Subsequent releases should contain database
  driving scripts in their respective database scripts directory.

  use q_time.sh output to calculate the power metric.
- Renamed scripts/pgsql/get_throughput.pl to scripts/pgsql/get_throughput.sh
  and made it use q_time.sh output to calculate the throughput metric.
- Improved usage for scripts/pgsql/start_db.sh.in.
