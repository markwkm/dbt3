v1.10

- Updated scripts to allow running against non-default ports for PostgreSQL.
- Updated database stat collection scripts for PostgreSQL.
- Improved load performance for PostgreSQL by putting the COPY command as
  part of the same transaction as the CREATE TABLE command.  v8.2 or newer
  required to take advantage of this.
- An assortment of script cleanups.
- Added some support for MySQL.  The scripts are not fully integrated yet.

v1.9

- Fixed a couple of parameter issues with scripts.
- Fixed the order of table names and index names when analyzing PostgreSQL
  database statistics.

v1.8

- Updated scripts/pgsql/create_tables.sh.in to not build primary keys when
  creating the tables.  Primary keys are created in
  scripts/pgsql/create_indexes.sh.in now.
- More cleaning up in the scripts.

v1.7

- Fixed release to include scripts/init_seed.sh.

v1.6

- Removed the builddb directory.  Subsequent releases should contain database
  building scripts int their respective database scripts directory.
- Removed the data_collect directory.  Subsequent releases should contain
  database data collection scripts int their respective database scripts
  directory.  Moved any general usage scripts into the scripts/ directory.
- Removed the dbdriver directory.  Subsequent releases should contain database
  driving scripts in their respective database scripts directory.
- Reorganized the datagen queries directory into a queries/ directory.
- Simplified the execution scripts.
- Reorganized the tree.
- Probably broke the scripts for SAP DB.
- Improved configure.ac (renamed from configure.in.)
- Removed building of dbgen from the Makefile.am until the makefile for dbgen
  can be adapted into automake.
- Stop calculating the power metric in perl and now in C.  It appeared that
  perl cannot calculate the metric if the numbers got too big.
- Renamed scripts/pgsql/get_power.pl to scripts/pgsql/get_power.sh and made it
  use q_time.sh output to calculate the power metric.
- Renamed scripts/pgsql/get_throughput.pl to scripts/pgsql/get_throughput.sh
  and made it use q_time.sh output to calculate the throughput metric.
- Improved usage for scripts/pgsql/start_db.sh.in.
- Modified scripts/pgsql/throughput_test.sh.in so it will exit and stop the
  test if a script fails.
- Fixed scripts/run_workload.sh.in
